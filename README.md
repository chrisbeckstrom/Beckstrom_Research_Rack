# Beckstrom Research modules for VCV Rack

Learning how to code some C++ and VCV Rack. Just a few plugins mostly based on existing ones so I can learn how it all works.

Free and open source. Enjoy! Make cool sounds.

# Modules

## High Frequency Oscillator (HFO)

Basically a fundamental VCO but it goes faster/higher. I like these on my hardware DIY modular <http://chrisbeckstrom.com/main/the-modular> to clock sequencers as sort-of programmable oscillators (try it out!).

## R/2R Ladder

A super simple emulation of a resistor ladder found in Lunetta's/CMOS noisemakers/etc. More info: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor_ladder>

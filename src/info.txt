what the various files are:

BR.cpp

"the plugin-wide instance of the plugin class," whatever that means. looks like it's just where you list your "company's" plugins.

BR.hpp

the header file maybe, whatever that is? don't think I have to do anything with it, just leave it there

BR_HFO.cpp (and others.cpp, etc)

the actual plugin source code files. each plugin will have a different .cpp file. make sure to reference them in BR.cpp
